# Clearvision Addons

Addons created for Clearvision theme. Some might not work properly with other themes, but they should work for most.

Support: [ClearVision Support Server](https://discord.gg/7pNUC9C)

Transparency
------------

Makes your Discord transparent. Maintained by Nyx.
Note: This **REQUIRES** your injector to support transparency. BetterDiscord, Replugged, and Vencord are the 3 clients we provide direct support for that also have transparency. If you are using any other injector, you may not have access to transparency.

### Usage

1.  Copy and paste the following below the other imports

    ```css
    @import url(https://clearvision.github.io/Addons/transparency.css);
    ```
    
2.  Change your --background-image variable to `transparent`:

    ```css
    --background-image: transparent; /* app background image (link must be HTTPS) [default: url(https://clearvision.github.io/images/sapphire.jpg)] */
    ```

3.  Make sure to toggle the background transparency toggle in BetterDiscord settings if you are on that, or any other relevant toggle if you are on another injector that supports transparency.
